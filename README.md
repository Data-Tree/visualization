# DataTree Module 5: Visualization

This repository contains code examples relating to the [Visualization module](https://datatree.org.uk/course/view.php?id=5) of the [DataTree](https://datatree.org.uk/) online course, presented as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). The best way to view the examples is to follow these links:

 - [Experimenting with colour scales](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Tree/visualization/blob/master/colourscales/Experimenting%20with%20colour%20scales.ipynb)
 - [Exploring map projections](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Tree/visualization/blob/master/projections/Exploring%20map%20projections.ipynb)
 - [Visualizing timeseries data](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Tree/visualization/blob/master/timeseries/Visualizing%20timeseries.ipynb)
 - [Interactive visualization](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Tree/visualization/blob/master/interactivity/Interactive%20visualization.ipynb)


## Running the examples yourself

If you want to run the examples yourself, you will need to download the code from this repository: click "Clone or download" (green button) above, or download the files individually by browsing the file tree above.

Examples require [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to run, plus some common scientific packages:

 - [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) - numeric data handling
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) - plotting and charting
 - [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) - for geographic data
 - [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/) - interactive visualization

Many Python distributions (e.g. [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) and [Python(x,y)](https://python-xy.github.io)) will include most or all of these libraries already, but you may need to install some yourself. For example, if you use a Conda-based distribution you may have to run:

```conda install -c conda-forge cartopy```

to install Cartopy. Check the documentation of your Python distribution, or the web pages of the individual libraries, for more information.
